# [Calculator](https://mesfrum.github.io/Calculator)

A simple calculator, I made as a beginner project for The Odin Project - Foundations. Occasionally I update this repository to include and apply new things I have learnt. 

## Features 

* Can do simple mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Has a secondary display at the top that displays/holds operation to be conducted.
* Automatically seperates thousands with a comma - ','
* Keyboard integration available. No need of using mouse/touchpad.
* Dynamic Background 

## Improvements to be made 

* Mobile compatibilty yet to integrated.
* Operations such as percentage and exponents are not featured.

I will be implementing these improvements gradually. And am welcome to suggestions.
